Since the beginning of Coronavirus, many people have had to change theire habits, or usual way of doing things, some people who used to got to school, now study at home, some of them have bean trying to get in the habit or learning and studying at their own.

How may habits cnnect with studying and learning today\'s education tips will explore that very question. Habits are regular way of dealing  with environment, you generally don't pay attention to them. In the book `<Good habits Bad Habits>`，Doctor Wendy Wood notes that a habit turns the world arround you -- you context-- into a trigger to act.

Habits take many forms, eating, exercising and even studying, you may not realize it, but habits make up many of the actions that you do every day. In the book Atomic Habits James Clear describes a four-step process by which habits are made. “These steps are Cue, Carving, Response and Reward. The Cue tell your brain to begin the behavior. The Carving is what makes you want to do something. The response is the actual habit you perform, the responses in turn give you reward. Rewards are the end goal of every habit” Clear writes! 

Consider the example, may be you have the habit of checking social media, the cue might be a feeling of boredom while near you computer or phone. The carving could be a desire to stop that feeling. The response is checking social media and the reward is seeing something interesting. When that process is repeated many times, it becomes a habit. Clear believe that to create a good habit you need to follow several steps, you need to make your habit obvious, or easy to see or understand, the habit should also be attractive, simple and satisfying.

You should organize you surroundings in such a way that you cues of you new habit are very obvious. For example, if you want to get in the habit of studying English everyday, leave English books or notes in a very clear place. 

To make your habits attractive, Clear recommend driving a culture, where your new desired behavior is been normal behavior, for example you could join a group of other English learners in a line meetings. 

To make your new habit easy, you could decrease the number of steps you have to take in order to study, you could also try reducing the amount of time you study. Clear suggests beginning you habits with limited shorter time periods, two minutes, for example, as you repeat the practice overtime, you can go longer, and an important point to keep in mind is that if you put too many demands on yourself, you are more likely to give up on your new habit. 

Finally, you need to make you habits satisfying, you can give yourself a reward after completing your new habit, for example, if you study English for fifteen minutes, you could reward yourself by listening to a song your like, or you could think how much progress you have made since you first started studying English.

Woods notes that your are reward should come right after you do your new habit, rewards have to be experienced right after we do something in order to build habit an associations in memory, she writes. Building new habits can take time, you may have to repeat an action many times before it becomes a habit. But with time, careful planning and continue practice, you can do it.

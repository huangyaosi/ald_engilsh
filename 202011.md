Habits take many forms, eating, exercising and even studying, you may not realize it, but habits make up many of the actions that you do every day.In the book Atomic Habits James clear describes a four steps process by which habits a made. These steps are Cue, Carving, Response and Reward. The Cue tell your brain to begin the behavior. The Carving is what makes you want to do something. The response is the actual habit you perform, the responses in turn give you reward. Rewards are the end goal of every habit, clear rights! Consider the example, may be you have the habit of checking social media, the cue might be a feeling of bottom while near you computer or phone. The carving could be a desire to stop that feeling. The response is checking social media and the reward is seeing something interesting. When that process is repeated many times, it becomes a habit. Clear believe that to create a good habit you need to follow several steps, you need to make your habit obvious, or easy to see and understand, the habit should also be attractive, simple and satisfying.
